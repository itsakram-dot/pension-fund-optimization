## Pension Fund Optimization using Linear Programming

### Overview  
Analyzed pension fund investment strategies to minimize initial cash needs under different economic scenarios, using Linear Programming (LP).

### Scenarios Analyzed:
- **Base Case:** Stable 4% interest rate  
- **Bad Case:** Declining interest rates (4% → 0% → 2%)

### Techniques & Tools:
- **Optimization:** Linear Programming (Gurobi)
- **Programming:** Python, Gurobi optimization package
- **Analysis:** Investment decision modeling, sensitivity analysis

### Key Results:
- **Optimal Initial Investment (Base Case):** $197,768.40  
- **Additional Cash Required (Bad Case):** $34,280  
- **Critical Pension Adjustment Years:** 5, 11, 14, and 15  

### Files Included:
- **`Case Assignment 1-1.ipynb`** *(Jupyter Notebook detailing optimization steps and Python code)*
- **`annotated-Case Assignment 1-1 - Uw1891-1.pdf`** *(Detailed mathematical analysis and LP solution insights)*
- **`Pension Fund Analysis.pdf`** *(Summary report and business insights)*

### Practical Takeaways:
- Maintain cash buffers for economic downturns.
